  Maintain a clean, modular, and scalable folder structure for the project, following the example below:

  D:\mywork\
  ├── wcab/            # Flutter Mobile App
  ├── wcab-b/          # Laravel Backend
  ├── wcab-p/          # React Admin Panel
  └── wcab-doc/        # Documentation

  Guidelines:
    - Group related features, screens, and components into their own folders (e.g., /screens, /widgets, /services).
    - Separate logic, UI, and service/network code into distinct files.
    - Use clear, descriptive, and consistent file and folder names.
    - Each file should have a single responsibility to maximize readability and maintainability.
    - Avoid placing excessive code in a single file; refactor into smaller units as needed.
    - Keep documentation and guides in a dedicated documentation folder.
